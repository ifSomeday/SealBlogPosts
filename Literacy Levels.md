# Analysis of the General Literacy of SEAL Members
*by Will A.K.A. Toshino Kyouko !!


Hey all,

This is an in-depth investigation into the Literacy of the SEAL Community.
Raw data can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/raw/ZqET3tCQ), collected on 10/18/2017

Excel spreadsheet can be found in the `/literacy_resources` directory of this repository. This sheet contains lists sorted for each category.

Skip to the end to see the Complete Literacy List

### Message Count:

Total messages processed from SEAL discord: 243762

Average Messages sent per user: 1377.19

Median Messages sent per user: 99

Channels processed: All except the *shadow-council*

**Top 5:**

User | Message Count 
---------|---------
Potato Farmer | 21337 
Truckwaffle | 18623 
Tree | 16791 
h! | 13988
Panda | 12033

Here we can see that my boy Potato Farmer easily sends the most messages, about twice as many as 5th Place (Panda). This is good news for his literacy ranking. I'd also like to give honorable mention to Spence Dotes. Seeing as he was not in the discord for most (all?) of the first season 1, yet still comes in 6th with 11926 messages, I expect big things out of him in the future.


### Word Length:
Average word length: 5.60

Median word length: 4.45

**Top 5 (> 200 messages, no bots):**

User | Word Length
---------|---------
Teresa | 5.49
Wolf | 5.24
Linkdx | 5.16 
Finite | 5.13
gharnef | 5.13

The majority of the server lies within ~1.5 characters of each other. I'd like to give a shoutout to oblvnxknight's cat for acheiving an average word length of about 80, by far the top in the server.
Danny ranks 6th in terms of word length (5.09), meaning he is the most accomplished admin in terms of vocabulary. Other admins fall to 51st (Panda), 66th (h!), 67th (Tx), and 71st (Tree).


### Word Count:

Average word count: 5.76

Median word count: 5.33

**Top 5 (> 200 messages, no bots):**

User | Word Count
---------|---------
Toes | 11.36
Danny | 11.08
Krenn | 9.28 
Dolly | 8.21
Rock | 7.97

Our first breakthrough finding comes from these results. **Age = more words**. The majority of the server is in the 4-5 word count range, so this top 5 more removed from the general population than the other top 5s.

### Character Count:

*nonwhitespace characters, custom emoji count as ~11-12 usually*

Average Character Count: 28.76

Median Character Count: 24.82

**Top 5 (> 200 messages, no bots):**

User | Character Count 
---------|---------
Danny | 56.39
Toes | 48.36
Krenn | 43.97
Kabobrocks | 39.54
Dolly | 37.53 

Here we have our second major breakthrough. **More Words = More Characters**. This trend begins to show when you compare Word Count and Character Count Top 5s, but is even more apparent when looking at this graph.

Again oblvnxknight and his cat are screwing with our data, so here is a graph with his entry removed

### Admin Findings:
I will now attempt to classify the admins by their literacy levels.

These rankings *include* users with <200 and bots

User | Messages | Length | Words | Characters
---------|---------|---------|---------|---------
Danny | 27th | 34th | 8th | 8th
Tx | 31st | 65th | 30th | 27th
Panda | 5th | 49th | 45th | 32nd
h! | 4th | 64th | 49th | 47th
Tree | 3rd | 69th | 66th | 63rd

From this I can conclude the following:

**Danny:** Well spoken, most literate

**Tx:** Doesn't talk too much, above average talking statistics

We now have the 3 Goon admins, who send a lot of messages, but dont have much substance in terms of words or word lengths:

**Panda:** One of the 3 Goons, most literate of the 3

**h!:** One of the 3 Goons, the middle Goon

**Tree:** Total Goon, the Gooniest of Goons, GoonKing Prime


### General Findings:

I had a request for more pie charts, so here is a useless pie chart of Messages by sender. Unlabeled, of course. 

![Messages 1](/Messages1.png)

Look, a second pie chart with a third pie chart protrueding from it like something from *Laser Cats 3*

![Messages 2](/Messages2.png)

Now, lets take a look at Message count vs Word length, word count, and character count:

![Message Count vs Word Length](/message_word_length.png)
![Message Count vs Word Count](/message_word_count.png)
![Message Coutn vs Character Count](/message_character_count.png)

These are not very interesting in all honesty. The only slightly interesting thing is that for the very high message count users, there is not much deviation in terms of the other 3 categories. The majority of the variation occours within the users with very low message counts, and this can very likely be explained with sample size.


### Potato Farmer

Mr. Potato is ranked 1st in message count, but relatively low in the other categories. I diagnose this as a severe case of verbal diahria. however, this is easily cured. As long as potato increases his *custom* emoji count, his literacy level will increase. This is shown in the following graph:

![Potato Emoji Graph](/potato_emoji_usage.png)


### Grand Results:

Time to do the final literacy rankings. In order to do this, I did a weighted average. Character Count was **not** included, because that is simply a function of word count and word length. Instead I used *word count* with a weight of 2, *word length* with a weight of 2, and *message count* with a weight of 1. Raw results can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/raw/avu3RcwX).

**Top 5 (> 200 messages, no bots):**

User | Average Rank 
---------|---------
Wolf | 19
Danny | 22.2
Kabobrocks | 35.4
Krenn | 36.4
gharnef | 37.8 

Special mention to Kaede Bot managing to come in 4th by only reposting things Rabbi- deleted. Yeah I'm certain this was a good use of my time MORE TO COME
