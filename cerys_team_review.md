# Cerys Team Review
## by Will

Hello, you might recognize me as the epic gamer that saved Cerys’ rd2l team from playoffs by going Midas witchdoctor in two games and managing to lose both. In this post I will detail why you all should be grateful for my sacrifice; the Cerys squad would have absolutely smashed you chumps in playoffs.

First off, you got elite gamer Luke in the middle lane. Look, here he is [smashing known North American Regional Qualifying Gamer Empyrean Dota](https://www.opendota.com/matches/3311780860). Now look at this glorious [game](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/4091288812). I bet you guys have never even seen someone with so much GPM and so little hero damage. Your minds cant even begin to comprehend the turbo brain thoughts that went into that game. When asked about his thought process he explained, “I really only made one mistake that game. I should not have hit rhasta in lane for 61 damage, it really messed up my stats.”

In the 1 role you have known weeb Yumi, an ld2l veteran who is known for having a hero pool the size of something very small I’m blanking on small bodies of water here. However, he has really stepped it up, and if you look at his recent rd2l match history, you will see that he has added at least 2 more heroes to his repertoire.

In the 3 role you have another ld2l gamer boy in Charkhil. Chark is a Doom connoisseur. Not native to the 3 role, Chark jumped right into it and proved his mettle in the big leagues. This man is unstoppable, and was a key component in the squad’s unheard of success.

Their 4 is Old School RuneScape legend and reputable immortal gamer Noah. Noah is the undebatable best 4 gamer in rd2l, known for his ability to do whatever he wants and make it work. Noah also was an early supporter of my position 4 ember spirit and 5 Dragon Knight, so you know his brain is absolutely massive. 

Last, but certainly not least, we have the Captain and back bone of the team, Cerys Dota. In addition to crafting an impeccable line up of players, her position 5 playing leaves nothing to be desired. Cerys is proof that not all of ld2l is a mistake (just most of it), and managed to not grief Yumi in lane, something that is difficult given his goonery. 

An honorable mention goes to DerpyDots. A series of hard hitting investigative articles were posted to the team discord, exposing this crooked admin. DerpyDots was found guilty of bribing officials with Clare's feet pix, attempting to silence his critics (like Truckwaffle), and calling a notavle community figure a "Magikarp" which was apparently quite insulting. In the end, DerpyDots ultimately succeeded in taking down Cerys' team, but they did not go down without a fight.

If after reading this think piece you still are not scared of this teams raw, untapped potential that was unfortunately cut short by real life vacation commitments and DerpyDots' schemeing, you are an absolute moron. This team would have clapped all your so called “playoff favorites” cheeks, and would have looked absolutely pristine doing it.
